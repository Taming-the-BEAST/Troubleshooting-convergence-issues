\section{Background}\label{background}}

The primary goal of most phylogenetic analyses in BEAST is to infer the
posterior distribution of trees and associated model parameters using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In this tutorial, we will
learn how to analyze the output of a MCMC analysis in BEAST using
Tracer. This program allows us to easily visualize BEAST's output and
summarize results. As we will see, we can also use Tracer to
troubleshoot some of the most common MCMC problems encountered in BEAST.

While BEAST's MCMC algorithm is fairly well optimised for phylogenetic
inference, problems can arise, especially as the complexity of our data
and models increase. A MCMC run may not converge on a stationary target
distribution. More commonly, a run might converge but mix poorly -
meaning our samples from the posterior are highly autocorrelated and
therefore not independent. In these cases, it is often necessary to tune
the performance of the MCMC algorithm.

\hypertarget{beast2---bayesian-evolutionary-analysis-sampling-trees-2}{%
\subsubsection{BEAST2 - Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees
2}\label{beast2---bayesian-evolutionary-analysis-sampling-trees-2}}

BEAST2 (\url{http://www.beast2.org}) is a free software package for
Bayesian evolutionary analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC and
strictly oriented toward inference using rooted, time-measured
phylogenetic trees. This tutorial is written for BEAST v\{\{
page.beastversion \}\} \citep{BEAST2book2014}.

\hypertarget{beauti2---bayesian-evolutionary-analysis-utility}{%
\subsubsection{BEAUti2 - Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis
Utility}\label{beauti2---bayesian-evolutionary-analysis-utility}}

BEAUti2 is a graphical user interface tool for generating BEAST2 XML
configuration files.

Both BEAST2 and BEAUti2 are Java programs, which means that the exact
same code runs on all platforms. For us it simply means that the
interface will be the same on all platforms. The screenshots used in
this tutorial are taken on a Mac OS X computer; however, both programs
will have the same layout and functionality on both Windows and Linux.
BEAUti2 is provided as a part of the BEAST2 package so you do not need
to install it separately.

\hypertarget{tracer}{%
\subsubsection{Tracer}\label{tracer}}

Tracer (\url{http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer}) is used to
summarise the posterior estimates of the various parameters sampled by
the Markov Chain. This program can be used for visual inspection and to
assess convergence. It helps to quickly view median estimates and 95\%
highest posterior density intervals of the parameters, and calculates
the effective sample sizes (ESS) of parameters. It can also be used to
investigate potential parameter correlations. We will be using Tracer
v\{\{ page.tracerversion \}\}.

\hypertarget{practical-troubleshooting-starting-issues}{%
\section{Practical: Troubleshooting starting
issues}\label{practical-troubleshooting-starting-issues}}

In this part of the tutorial, we will see several issues which can
prevent a BEAST2 inference from even starting, and demonstrate how to
fix them.

\hypertarget{the-data}{%
\subsection{The Data}\label{the-data}}

All examples in this section are inspired by real issues encountered
during the analysis of the convergent evolution of true crabs
\citep{Wolfe2022}. The dataset used is composed of sequences for 344
extant species of the infraorder Brachyura, in addition to fossil
calibrations or fossil samples for this clade. Note that the runs
presented here have been simplified from the original, in particular
many of the alignment partitions used in the original analysis have been
removed.

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

The following packages are required to run the examples: SA, CA, SSM.

\begin{framed}
Launch \textbf{BEAUti}, then open the \textbf{BEAST2 Package Manager} by
navigating to \textbf{File \textgreater{} Manage Packages}. (Figure
\ref{packageManage1})
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/package_manager.png}
    \caption{Finding the BEAST2 Package Manager.}
    \label{packageManage1}
\end{figure}

\begin{framed}
Install the \textbf{CA}, \textbf{SA} and \textbf{SSM} packages by
selecting them and clicking the \textbf{Install/Upgrade} button. (Figure
\ref{packageManage2})
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.700000\textwidth]{figures/packages.png}
    \caption{The BEAST2 Package Manager.}
    \label{packageManage2}
\end{figure}

BEAUti needs to be closed for the newly installed packages to be loaded
properly.

\begin{framed}
Close the \textbf{BEAST2 Package Manager} and \textbf{BEAUti}.
\end{framed}

\hypertarget{xml-parsing-issue}{%
\subsection{XML parsing issue}\label{xml-parsing-issue}}

\begin{framed}
Download the BEAST input file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing.xml!} and
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_1xmlparsing\_working.xml!}. Open
\textbf{BEAST2} and select the file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing.xml!} as input file. Start the
run with the \textbf{Run} button. You should get an error message, as
shown in Figure \ref{errorParsing}.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/error_xml.png}
    \caption{Error message in BEAST2.}
    \label{errorParsing}
\end{figure}

Here the run failed to start because the XML configuration file could
not be parsed, as explained by the error message \emph{Error 110 parsing
the xml input file}. Thankfully the error message tells us exactly where
the error happened (\emph{}) and what is the issue (\emph{Input `tree'
must be specified.}). If we open the
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing.xml!} file and look for
\textbf{rate.c:12S}, we can see that line 1297 corresponds to the error
message and reads as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
    <log id="rate.c:12S" spec="beast.evolution.branchratemodel.RateStatistic" branchratemodel="@RelaxedClock.c:12S"/>
\end{lstlisting}

By comparing to a previous (working) analysis in the file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_1xmlparsing\_working.xml!}, we can see
that the correct configuration should be (line 497):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
    <log id="rate.c:12S" spec="beast.evolution.branchratemodel.RateStatistic" branchratemodel="@RelaxedClock.c:12S" tree="@Tree.t:concat"/>
\end{lstlisting}

As the error message told us, the \textbf{tree} element of the
configuration is missing in the non-working XML file. Putting it back
allows us to start the run.

\begin{framed}
Open the file \passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing.xml!} in a text
editor. Modify \textbf{line 1297} of the file to add the
\passthrough{\lstinline!tree="@Tree.t:concat"!} element. Save the file
as \passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing\_fixed.xml!}. Open
\textbf{BEAST2} and select the file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_xmlparsing\_fixed.xml!} as input file.
Start the run with the \textbf{Run} button. Now it works!
\end{framed}

XML parsing errors usually occur when the XML file has been manually
edited and parts of the configuration have been accidentally deleted or
modified. This is why it's important to always keep a copy of the
original XML when making manual edits, as this provides an easy way to
check the correct configuration. If an XML parsing error occurs in a
file which was generated entirely through BEAUti, then this is likely a
BEAUti bug and should be reported to the development team.

\hypertarget{issue-with-finding-an-initial-state}{%
\subsection{Issue with finding an initial
state}\label{issue-with-finding-an-initial-state}}

\begin{framed}
Download the BEAST input file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_2nonstarting.xml!}. Open \textbf{BEAST2}
and select the file \passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_2nonstarting.xml!} as
input file. Start the run with the \textbf{Run} button. You should get
an error message, as shown in Figure \ref{errorStarting}.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/error_initial.png}
    \caption{Another error message in BEAST2.}
    \label{errorStarting}
\end{figure}

In this situation, the inference failed to start because a good initial
state could not be found, as explained by the error message (\emph{Fatal
exception: Could not find a proper state to initialise.}). This issue is
much more complex to diagnose than the previous one, as it can be caused
by many different parts of the analysis configuration. However, as above
the error message provides some information on the source of the
problem, as it details the probability of all the components of the
analysis. The message reads \emph{P(FBD.t:concat) = -Infinity}, showing
that the issue likely appears in the calculation of the FBD likelihood.
The FBD prior is a tree prior, and depends on the tree as well as
several other parameters, so there are several possible causes for the
calculation issue:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  a bug in the likelihood calculation itself: BEAST2 packages can
  contain calculation issues which have been undetected so far
  (especially if they only appear in very specific circumstances), in
  which case they should be reported to the development team. However,
  this is unlikely in our case, as the FBD model has been extensively
  used without issue in previous analyses, and our analysis setup is
  similar to previous analyses.
\item
  an issue with the initial tree: the inference will not start if the
  provided initial tree is impossible under the specified tree model or
  doesn't match with the provided MRCA constraints. By default, most
  analyses use a random tree simulated by the inference, which will
  fulfill all constraints. However, with more complex models or
  constraints, the simulation process can fail to find a good tree, in
  which case a valid starting tree needs to be provided by the user.
\item
  an issue with the initial values of the parameters: if the initial
  values set in the analysis are very far from plausible, the resulting
  likelihood of the model will be extremely small, which gets recorded
  as \emph{-Infinity} by BEAST2.
\end{itemize}

To inspect the starting values and find the issue, we will first load
the file into BEAUti.

\begin{framed}
Open BEAUti and load in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_2nonstarting.xml!} file by navigating to
\textbf{File \textgreater{} Load}.
\end{framed}

The starting tree can be found in the \textbf{Starting tree} panel,
which is hidden by default.

\begin{framed}
Open the \textbf{Starting tree} panel by navigating to \textbf{View
\textgreater{} Show Starting tree panel}. Switch to the \textbf{Starting
tree} panel.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/startingTree.png}
    \caption{Starting tree panel.}
    \label{startingTree}
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{startingTree}, the initial tree in this
analysis is set to a Newick tree, chosen by the user. The
\textbf{Newick} box gives the full Newick string, which we could use to
inspect the tree in an other program. This string can also be copied
directly from the XML file. First, we will check if this tree is
compatible with the tree constraints set in the \textbf{Priors} panel.

\begin{framed}
Switch to the \textbf{Priors} panel. Click on the arrow left of the
\textbf{Root.prior} to see the details of this prior (Figure
\ref{rootPrior}).
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/rootPrior.png}
    \caption{Priors panel showing the root prior.}
    \label{rootPrior}
\end{figure}

The only constraint set on the tree is a prior on the age of the root,
which we can see in the \textbf{Priors} panel. By checking the details,
we can see that this is a wide lognormal prior, with the 5\% quantile of
the prior at 206 Ma and the 95\% quantile at 437 Ma. Let's import our
starting tree in Icytree to check if the root age is compatible with the
prior.

\begin{framed}
Open Icytree (\url{https://icytree.org/}) in a web browser. Copy the
Newick string from the \textbf{Starting tree} panel or from the XML
file. Paste the string into a blank text file and save it as
\passthrough{\lstinline!starting.tre!}. Drag and drop the
\passthrough{\lstinline!starting.tre!} file into Icytree.
\end{framed}

By hovering over the root node of the starting tree, we can see that its
age is set to \textbf{305.91 Ma}, which is consistent with the root
prior set in the analysis.

Next, we will inspect the starting values of the parameters of the FBD
model, found in the \textbf{Priors} panel in \textbf{BEAUti}. The FBD
model has 3 parameters: the diversification rate, the turnover and the
sampling proportion. For each parameter, the starting value is shown in
the box to the right, as \textbf{initial = {[}x{]} {[}min, max{]}}
(Figure \ref{initialVal}). Here \emph{x} indicates the starting value
and \emph{min} and \emph{max} the range of possible values for the
corresponding parameter. Thus we can see that the initial
diversification rate is \textbf{1.0}, the initial sampling proportion is
\textbf{0.5} and the initial turnover is \textbf{0.5}. These are the
default values for these parameters, but they may not be adapted to all
datasets. In particular, a diversification rate of 1.0/My is a very high
value - since our starting tree is 300 My old, it means that we would
expect about \textbf{exp(300 x 1.0) = 2 x 10$^{130}$} extant species.
Having a very implausible starting value for the diversification rate
could explain the failure we observed earlier when calculating the
likelihood of the FBD model, so we will change it to a more realistic
value of \textbf{0.01}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/initialVal.png}
    \caption{Initial values in the Priors panel.}
    \label{initialVal}
\end{figure}

\begin{framed}
In the \textbf{Priors} panel, click on the \textbf{initial = {[}1.0{]}}
box right of the \textbf{diversificationRateFBD} parameter. Change the
initial value in the \textbf{Value} box to \textbf{0.01} (Figure
\ref{initialDiv}). Click on \textbf{OK} to close the box. Save the
updated configuration as
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_2nonstarting\_fixed.xml!} by navigating
to \textbf{File \textgreater{} Save As}. Open \textbf{BEAST2} and select
\passthrough{\lstinline!part1\_2nonstarting\_fixed.xml!} as the input
file. Start the run with the \textbf{Run} button. It works now!
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{practical-convergence-issues}{%
\section{Practical: Convergence
issues}\label{practical-convergence-issues}}

In this part of the tutorial, we will consider a relatively simple
example where we would like to infer a phylogeny and evolutionary
parameters from a small alignment of sequences. Our job will be to work
together to increase the efficiency of the MCMC so we can get the
analysis to converge\ldots{}

\hypertarget{the-data-1}{%
\subsection{The Data}\label{the-data-1}}

To get started, I have generated a XML file that we can run our
phylogenetic analysis in BEAST.

\begin{framed}
Download the first BEAST input file
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run1.xml!}
\end{framed}

The XML contains an alignment of 36 randomly simulated DNA sequences.

\hypertarget{inspecting-the-xml-file-in-beauti}{%
\subsection{Inspecting the XML file in
BEAUti}\label{inspecting-the-xml-file-in-beauti}}

While we can open the XML file in any standard text editor, BEAUTi
offers an easy way to inspect the different elements of the analysis:

\begin{framed}
Open BEAUti and load in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run1.xml!} file by navigating
to \textbf{File \textgreater{} Load}.
\end{framed}

By navigating between the different tabs at the top of the application
window, we can inspect the data and each element of the analysis. For
example, in the \textbf{Site Model} panel, we can see that we are
fitting a GTR substitution model with no gamma rate heterogeneity
(Figure \ref{fig:beauti_run1}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/beauti_run1.png}
    \caption{The Site Model panel in BEAUTi}
    \label{fig:beauti_run1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{running-the-xml-in-beast}{%
\subsubsection{Running the XML in
BEAST}\label{running-the-xml-in-beast}}

We are now ready to run our first analysis in BEAST.

\begin{framed}
Open BEAST and choose
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run1.xml!} as the BEAST XML
file. Then click \textbf{Run}.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.500000\textwidth]{figures/beast_input_run1.png}
    \caption{Running BEAST with the specified XML configuration file.}
    \label{fig:beast_run1}
\end{figure}

Since we are only running 200,000 iterations, the MCMC should finish
running in under 30 seconds.

\hypertarget{visualizing-beasts-output-in-tracer}{%
\subsubsection{Visualizing BEAST's output in
Tracer}\label{visualizing-beasts-output-in-tracer}}

\begin{framed}
Open Tracer and navigate to \textbf{File \textgreater{} Import Trace
File}, then open \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run1.log!}
\end{framed}

The results of your run will look similar, but not necessarily
identical, to my results shown in Figure \ref{fig:beast_run1}.

Tracer allows us to quickly visualize BEAST's MCMC output in order to
check performance and see our parameter estimates. On the left there is
a panel where all model parameters are listed along with their mean
posterior estimates and Effective Sample Size (ESS). Recall that the ESS
tells us how many pseudo-independent samples we have from the posterior,
so the higher the better. Here, we can see that the ESS is low for all
parameters, indicating that we do not yet have a good estimate of the
posterior distribution.

By selecting a parameter in the left panel and then clicking on the
\textbf{Trace} tab, we can see how the MCMC explored parameter space
(Figure \ref{fig:tracer_run1}). For the \textbf{clockRate} parameter for
instance, we see that the chain quickly converged to a value of about
0.01 (the true value used to simulate the sequence data), but mixing was
poor, hence the low ESS.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/tracer_run1.png}
    \caption{Trace plot of the clock rate parameter}
    \label{fig:tracer_run1}
\end{figure}

We can also see our posterior estimates for each parameter by clicking
on the \textbf{Estimates} tab while highlighting the desired parameter
in the left panel. This provides us with various summary statistics and
a frequency histogram representing our estimate of the posterior
distribution constructed from our MCMC samples. For the
\textbf{clockRate} parameter, we can see that our estimate of the
posterior is extremely rough, again because we have so few uncorrelated
samples from the posterior (Figure \ref{fig:tracer_run1_ests}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/tracer_run1_ests.png}
    \caption{Posterior estimates of the clock rate parameter in Tracer.}
    \label{fig:tracer_run1_ests}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{run-2-increasing-the-chain-length}{%
\subsubsection{Run 2: Increasing the chain
length}\label{run-2-increasing-the-chain-length}}

By checking the ESS, trace plots and parameter estimates, we got the
picture that none of our parameters in Run 1 mixed well. In this case,
the simplest thing to try is to rerun the MCMC for more iterations.

\begin{framed}
Load the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run1.xml!} back into
BEAUti using \textbf{File \textgreater{} Load}. Navigate to the MCMC
panel and increase the chain length to 1 million. You may also want to
change the file name for the log file to
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.log!} and to
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.trees!} for the tree file
so we do not overwrite our previous results. When done, navigate
\textbf{File \textgreater{} Save As} and save as
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.xml!}.
\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
Run the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.xml!} file in
BEAST as we did before. When done, open the
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.log!} in Tracer.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/beauti_run2.png}
    \caption{Increasing the chain length in BEAUTi}
    \label{fig:beauti_run2}
\end{figure}

Looking at the MCMC output in Tracer, we see that that increasing the
chain length did help some (Figure \ref{fig:tracer_run2}). The ESS
values are higher and the traces look better, but still not great. In
the next section, we will continue to focus on the \textbf{clockRate}
parameter because it still has a low ESS and appears to mix especially
poorly.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/tracer_run2.png}
    \caption{Trace plot of the clock rate parameter}
    \label{fig:tracer_run2}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{run-3-changing-the-clockrate-operators}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Run 3: Changing the \textbf{clockRate}
operators}{Run 3: Changing the clockRate operators}}\label{run-3-changing-the-clockrate-operators}}

If one parameter in particular is not converging or mixing well, we can
try to tweak that parameter's operator(s). Remember that BEAST's
operators control what new parameter values are proposed at each MCMC
iteration and how these proposals are made (i.e.~the proposal
distribution). Since the \textbf{clockRate} parameter was not mixing
well in Run 2, we will try increasing the frequency at which new
\textbf{clockRates} are proposed.

\begin{framed}
Load the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run2.xml!} back into
BEAUti and select \passthrough{\lstinline!View > Show Operators!} panel.
This will bring up a new panel showing all the operators in use (Figure
\ref{fig:beauti_run3}). Click on the black triangle next to
\passthrough{\lstinline!Scale:clockRate!}. In the menu that drops down,
check \textbf{Optimise}. In the box to the right of
\passthrough{\lstinline!Scale.clockRate!}, change the value from
\textbf{0.1} to \textbf{3.0}. Now navigate to the MCMC panel and change
the file name for the log file to
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.log!} and the tree file to
\passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.trees!}. When done, save
as \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.xml!}.
\end{framed}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/beauti_run3.png}
    \caption{The Operators panel in BEAUTi}
    \label{fig:beauti_run3}
\end{figure}

So, what just happened? We told BEAST to try to automatically optimise
the scale operator on the \textbf{clockRate}, which moves the parameter
value up or down. Note that by default, operators are automatically
optimised in BEAST, but for the purposes of this tutorial I turned off
auto-optimization to get especially bad mixing. We also increased the
weight on this scale operator so that new \textbf{clockRates} will be
proposed more often in the MCMC. Going from a weight of 0.1 to 3.0 means
that new proposals for that parameter will be made thirty times as
often, but the frequency at which a given operator is called depends on
the weights given to other operators. So if there are parameters with
very high ESS values, we may want to reallocate weight on their
operators to operators on less well mixing parameters. For fun, you may
want to guess what each operator in the \textbf{Operators} panel is
doing.

\begin{framed}
Run the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.xml!} in BEAST and
then open the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.log!} in
Tracer.
\end{framed}

We can see that optimizing the operator dramatically improves mixing for
the \textbf{clockRate} (Figure \ref{fig:tracer_run3}). But there is
still room for improvement.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/tracer_run3.png}
    \caption{Trace plot of the clock rate parameter}
    \label{fig:tracer_run3}
\end{figure}

One thing to keep in mind is that BEAST is using MCMC to explore a
multidimensional parameter space, and poor mixing in one dimension can
be caused by poor mixing in another dimension. This often arises because
two parameters are highly correlated. We can identify these correlations
in Tracer by visualizing the joint distribution of a pair of parameters
together. To do this, select one parameter in the left panel and then,
while holding the command key (Mac) or control key (Windows), select
another. Then click on the \textbf{Joint-Marginal} tab at the top.
Looking at the pairwise joint distribution for \textbf{TreeHeight} and
\textbf{clockRate}, we see that these two parameters are highly
negatively correlated (Figure \ref{fig:tracer_run3Joint}). We therefore
may want to add an operator that updates these parameters together to
more efficiently explore their parameter space.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.800000\textwidth]{figures/tracer_run3Joint.png}
    \caption{Joint posterior distribution of the tree height and clock rate}
    \label{fig:tracer_run3Joint}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{run-4-adding-an-updown-operator}{%
\subsubsection{Run 4: Adding an upDown
operator}\label{run-4-adding-an-updown-operator}}

The easiest way to improve MCMC performance when two parameters are
highly negatively correlated is to add an \textbf{UpDown} operator. This
operator scales one parameter up while scaling the other parameter down.
If two parameters are highly positively correlated we can also use this
operator to scale both parameters in the same direction, up or down.

\begin{framed}
Load the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run3.xml!} back into
BEAUti and select \passthrough{\lstinline!View > Show Operators!} panel.
Click on the black triangle next to \textbf{UpDown clockRate}. In the
menu that drops down, check \textbf{Optimise}. In the box to the right,
change the weight on the UpDown operator from \textbf{0.0} to
\textbf{3.0}. In the MCMC panel, change the file name for the log file
to \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run4.log!} and the tree file
to \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run4.trees!}. When done,
save as part2\_tutorial\_run4.xml`.
\end{framed}

We just added an \textbf{UpDown} operator on the \textbf{clockRate} and
the \textbf{TreeHeight}. The fact that these two parameters are highly
negatively correlated makes perfect sense. An increase in the
\textbf{clockRate} means that less time is needed for substitutions to
accumulate along branches; meaning branches can be shorter and yet still
explain the same amount of accumulated evolutionary change in the
sequence data. If all branches in the tree become shorter, then the
total \textbf{TreeHeight} will also decrease. Thus it makes sense to
include an \textbf{UpDown} operator on \textbf{clockRate} and
\textbf{TreeHeight}. In fact, by default BEAUTi includes this operator.
However, I disabled it in the original XML file by setting the weight on
this operator to zero for the purpose of illustration.

\begin{framed}
Run the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run4.xml!} in BEAST and
then open the \passthrough{\lstinline!part2\_tutorial\_run4.log!} in
Tracer.
\end{framed}

Looking at the MCMC output in Tracer, we see that all parameters are
starting to mix well with relatively high ESS values. Personally, I
would probably want to run one final MCMC for several million iterations
just to be on the safe side, but this can easily be done by adding more
iterations to the chain as we did for Run 2. Alternatively, multiple
different MCMC runs can be combined using the program LogCombiner that
comes packaged with BEAST. This may be better than running one single
long analysis, as it allows us to be sure independent runs are
converging on similar parameters.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The number of MCMC iterations needed to achieve a reasonable posterior
  sample in this tutorial was quite small. With larger alignments, much
  longer chains may be needed.
\item
  In this tutorial we only considered MCMC performance with respect to
  exploring parameter space, but we also need to consider tree space.
  One simple diagnostic for checking convergence and mixing in tree
  space is to look at the trace plot for the tree likelihood. Poor
  mixing in the tree likelihood can indicate problems exploring tree
  space.
\item
  It is always a good idea to check your posterior estimates against
  sampling from the prior.
